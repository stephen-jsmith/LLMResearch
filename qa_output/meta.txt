{"prompt": "What are the advantages of Meta V3 over Meta V2?", "completion": "Meta V3 has several advantages over Meta V2. It is built on MongoDB version 4.2 technology and opens up the full functionality of MongoDB as a document store. Projects are free to create metadata and documents in a way that suits their needs. Some of the advantages include: any valid MongoDB document structure can be used, if a search runs in MongoDB CLI, it should run from the API, aggregations are available, database, collection and document creation can be managed by tenant administrator, and the performance is many times faster."}

{"prompt": "How can I migrate from Meta V2 to Meta V3?", "completion": "Migration from Meta V2 to Meta V3 can be accomplished by creating a new database with one or more collections for your project. The tenant administrator can request the initial permissions setup. Once your collection(s) are in place, move the result and associatedIds into your new document model."}

{"prompt": "How can I create a document in Meta V3?", "completion": "To add a json document to a collection in Meta V3, you can use CURL. The response will have an empty response body with a status code of 201 \"Created\" unless the \"basic\" url query parameter is set to true. Setting the \"basic\" parameter to true will give a Tapis Basic response along with the \"_id\" of the newly created document."}{"prompt": "How can I create a new collection in MongoDB?", "completion": "You can create a new collection of documents by specifying a collection name under a specific database. The API endpoint for this operation is /v3/meta/{db}/{collection}. The response will be 'Status: 201 Collection created' along with an Etag header value for collection identification."}

{"prompt": "How can I delete a collection in MongoDB?", "completion": "To delete a collection, you need to use an administrative method that is only available to tenant or meta administrators. This requires an If-Match header parameter of the Etag for the collection. The Etag value, if not already known, can be retrieved from the \"_meta\" call for a collection. The response will be 'Status: 204 Deleted named collection from the database'."}

{"prompt": "How can I create a new document within a collection in MongoDB?", "completion": "To create a new document within a collection, you need to submit a json document within the request body of a POST request. This will create a new document within the specified collection with a MongoDB autogenerated \"_id\". If you want to add multiple documents, you can POST an array of new documents with a request body for the specified collection. The response will be 'Status: 201 Document created'."}Insufficient data is provided.
