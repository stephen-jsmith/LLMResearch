{"prompt": "What is the Pods Service?", "completion": "The Pods Service is a web service and distributed computing platform providing pods-as-a-service (PaaS). The service implements a message broker and processor model that requests pods, alongside a health module to poll for pod data, including logs, status, and health. The primary use of this service is to have quick to deploy long-lived services based on Docker images that are exposed via HTTP or TCP endpoints listed by the API. The Pods service provides functionality for two types of pod solutions: Templated Pods for run-as-is popular images and Custom Pods for arbitrary docker images with less functionality."}

{"prompt": "How do I get started with the Pods Service?", "completion": "This Getting Started guide will walk you through the initial steps of setting up the necessary accounts and installing the required software before moving to the Pods Quickstart, where you will create your first Pods service pod. If you are already using Docker Hub and the TACC TAPIS APIs, feel free to jump right to the Pods Quickstart or check out the Pods Live Docs."}

{"prompt": "How do I create a TACC account to use the Pods Service?", "completion": "The main instance of the Pods platform is hosted at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). TACC designs and deploys some of the world's most powerful advanced computing technologies and innovative software solutions to enable researchers to answer complex questions. To use the TACC-hosted Pods service, please create a TACC account."}{"prompt": "How do I register a templated Pod using the tapipy library?", "completion": "To register a templated Pod using the tapipy library, you use the `pods.create_pod()` method and pass the arguments describing the pod you want to register through the function parameters. The pod_template should be equal to one of your templated pods."}

{"prompt": "How can I access my pod once it is in the `RUNNING` state?", "completion": "Once your pod is in the `RUNNING` state, and after the networking changes proliferate, you should have access to your pod via the internet. You can access your pod through the network using the url provided in the pod's description when creating the pod or when getting the pod description. In the pod response object, the `url` attribute gives you the url your service is being hosted on."}

{"prompt": "How can I retrieve the logs from my pod?", "completion": "The Pods service collects the latest 10 MB of logs from the pod when running and makes them available via the `logs` endpoint. To retrieve the logs from the pod, you use the `get_pod_logs()` method, passing in `pod_id`."}
