{"prompt": "What is Tapipy and how does it work?", "completion": "Tapipy is a Python library for interacting with an instance of the Tapis API framework. The library is automatically generated by referencing the OpenAPI spec files which a Tapis client built from the OpenAPI spec files from TACC's Tapis services. With this functionality a user is able to authorize itself with the Tapis client and have a 'live' library in order to interact with all Tapis services. Usage of tapipy allows for automatic token refreshing, verbose error messages regarding endpoint inputs, and up to date syntax for all services."}

{"prompt": "How do I initialize a Tapis client object using Tapipy?", "completion": "To initialize a Tapis client object, you will replace `your_tacc_username` and `your_tacc_password` with your TACC username and password, preserving the quotation marks shown in the command below. This command will authenticate you with Tapis for your respective `base_url` and store your retrieved token for later `tapipy` calls. The code is as follows: \n\n``` python\nfrom tapipy.tapis import Tapis\nt = Tapis(base_url= \"https://tacc.tapis.io\", username=\"your_tacc_username\", password=\"your_tacc_password\")\nt.get_tokens()\n```"}

{"prompt": "What are the special keyword arguments recognized by Tapipy?", "completion": "Tapipy recognizes two special keyword arguments to all of its methods that correspond to Tapis API calls (i.e., all of its \"operations\"). They are: `_tapis_headers` - a dictionary-like object of header names (keys) and values, and `_tapis_query_parameters` - a dictionary-like object of query parameter names (keys) and values. These special arguments are used for passing headers and query parameters that are not specified in the OpenAPI definition of an endpoint."}{"prompt": "How can I instantiate Tapipy with only a Tapis access token?", "completion": "Tapipy can be instantiated with only a Tapis access token. This is useful when you have a created token and don't want to provide username and password. The minimal instantiation requires the base_url and the token."}

{"prompt": "How can I refresh Tapipy's Cached Specs?", "completion": "Tapipy uses a cache to organize spec dictionaries as pickled files and has the ability to accept custom spec files. By default Tapipy keeps a set of base spec files in the `{tapipyInstallDir}/specs` folder. These specs are pre-pickled at package build time. To update specs, you can use `t.update_spec_cache()` or `tapipy.tapis.update_spec_cache()` methods."}

{"prompt": "How can I use `t.files.insert` with Tapipy for file upload?", "completion": "Introduced in Tapipy 1.3.2, the library now has native support for `multipart/form-data` input data and headers. This allows us to natively support the `t.files.insert` operation. The previous static workaround, `t.upload(filePath, systemId, local_file_path)`, is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release."}{"prompt": "How do I inherit from the flaskbase image in Docker?", "completion": "To inherit from the flaskbase image in Docker, you can use the command `FROM: tapis/flaskbase` in your Dockerfile."}
{"prompt": "How can I install additional requirements for the service in Docker?", "completion": "To install additional requirements for the service in Docker, you can copy your requirements.txt file into the Docker image and then run pip install. Here is an example of how you can do this in your Dockerfile: `COPY requirements.txt /home/tapis/requirements.txt RUN pip install -r /home/tapis/requirements.txt`"}
{"prompt": "How can I run a service as a non-root user in Docker?", "completion": "To run a service as a non-root user in Docker, you can use the `RUN` and `USER` commands in your Dockerfile. Here is an example: `RUN chown -R tapis:tapis /home/tapis USER tapis`"}{"prompt": "How do I set up logging in the `tapisservice.logs` module?", "completion": "To set up logging in the `tapisservice.logs` module, you need to create an instance of the logger in each module where you want to add logs. This can be done by calling the `get_logger` function with the module name."}

{"prompt": "How do I handle errors in REST APIs using the `tapisservice.util` module?", "completion": "To handle errors in REST APIs using the `tapisservice.util` module, you can use the `TapisApi` class and the `flask_errors_dict` dict and `handle_error()` function. Add the following to your `api.py` module: `from flask import Flask`, `from tapisservice.utils import TapisApi, handle_error, flask_errors_dict`. Then set up error handling to use the `handle_error()` function."}

{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the TapisApi object in TapisService?", "completion": "The TapisApi object in TapisService is created with the app object and the flask_errors_dict to establish the 4 stanza structure of error responses. For example, `api = TapisApi(app, errors=flask_errors_dict)`. It is then used to set up error handling with the `handle_error()` function."}{"prompt": "What are the variables exposed by `tapisservice`?", "completion": "`tapisservice` exposes two sets of similar variables: `g.request_username`, `g.username`, `g.x_tapis_user`, `g.request_tenant_id`, `g.tenant_id`, and `g.x_tapis_tenant`. The `g.request_username` and `g.request_tenant_id` resolve to the values obtained from the incoming request JWT Tapis token. However, the values change to the `x_tapis_*` variants when service accounts send 'on behalf of' requests."}

{"prompt": "How can I use `tapipy` as a Service Account?", "completion": "A service account can still make use of the `tapipy` client, with some changes. You can use the tenant and username from the client, which means the service's tenant and username. For example, `t.systems.get_systems(_tapis_set_x_headers_from_service = True)`. Alternatively, you can use specified `_x_tapis_user` and `_x_tapis_tenant_id` rather than the service's values. For example, `t.systems.get_systems(_x_tapis_user = 'cgarcia', _x_tapis_tenant_id = 'tacc')`."}

{"prompt": "What happens when service accounts send 'on behalf of' requests?", "completion": "When service accounts send 'on behalf of' requests, the values of `g.request_username` and `g.request_tenant_id` change to the `x_tapis_*` variants. This allows services to reference only one variable versus choosing to use `g.username` or `g.x_tapis_user` at runtime. Only services within the same site may complete these OBO requests, and this is checked by `tapisservice`."}
