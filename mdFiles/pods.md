# Introduction to the Pods Service

## What is the Pods Service

The Pods Service is a web service and distributed computing platform
providing pods-as-a-service (PaaS). The service implements a message
broker and processor model that requests pods, alongside a health module
to poll for pod data, including logs, status, and health. The primary
use of this service is to have quick to deploy long-lived services based
on Docker images that are exposed via HTTP or TCP endpoints listed by
the API.

The Pods service provides functionality for two types of pod solutions:

:   -   *Templated Pods* for run-as-is popular images. Neo4J is one
        example, the template manages TCP ports, user creation, and
        permissions.
    -   *Custom Pods* for arbitrary docker images with less
        functionality. In this case we will expose port 5000 and do
        nothing else.

## Using the Pods Service

Please create issues on our [github
repo](https://github.com/tapis-project/pods_service) and report problems
to Christian R. Garcia. The service is available to researchers and
students. To learn more about the the system, including getting access,
follow the instructions in `/getting-started/index`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

# Getting Started

This Getting Started guide will walk you through the initial steps of
setting up the necessary accounts and installing the required software
before moving to the Pods Quickstart, where you will create your first
Pods service pod. If you are already using Docker Hub and the TACC TAPIS
APIs, feel free to jump right to the [Pods Quickstart](#pods-quickstart)
or check out the [Pods Live
Docs](https://tapis-project.github.io/live-docs/?service=Pods).

## Account Creation and Software Installation

### Create a TACC account

The main instance of the Pods platform is hosted at the Texas Advanced
Computing Center ([TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu)). TACC designs and
deploys some of the world\'s most powerful advanced computing
technologies and innovative software solutions to enable researchers to
answer complex questions. To use the TACC-hosted Pods service, please
create a [TACC account](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request).

### Create a Docker account

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source container runtime
providing operating-system-level virtualization. The Pods service pulls
images for its pods from the public Docker Hub. To register pods you
will need to publish images on Docker Hub, which requires a [Docker
account](https://hub.docker.com/) .

### Install the Tapis Python SDK

To interact with the TACC-hosted Abaco platform in Python, we will
leverage the Tapis Python SDK, tapipy. To install it, simply run:

``` bash
$ pip3 install tapipy
```

`tapipy` works with Python 3.

## Working with TACC OAuth

Authentication and authorization to the Tapis APIs uses
[OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/), a widely-adopted web standard. Our
implementation of OAuth2 is designed to give you the flexibility you
need to script and automate use of Tapis while keeping your access
credentials and digital assets secure. This is covered in great detail
in our Tenancy and Authentication section, but some key concepts will be
highlighted here, interleaved with Python code.

### Create an Tapis Client Object

The first step in using the Tapis Python SDK, tapipy, is to create a
Tapis Client object. First, import the `Tapis` class and create python
object called `t` that points to the Tapis server using your TACC
username and password. Do so by typing the following in a Python shell:

::: important

:::

Support for Pods service in Tapipy was added in version 1.2.3.
:::

``` python
# Import the Tapis object
from tapipy.tapis import Tapis

# Log into you the Tapis service by providing user/pass and url.
t = Tapis(base_url='https://tacc.tapis.io',
          username='your username',
          password='your password')
```

### Generate a Token

With the `t` object instantiated, we can exchange our credentials for an
access token. In Tapis, you never send your username and password
directly to the services; instead, you pass an access token which is
cryptographically signed by the OAuth server and includes information
about your identity. The Tapis services use this token to determine who
you are and what you can do.

``` python
# Get tokens that will be used for authenticated function calls
t.get_tokens()
print(t.access_token.access_token)

Out[1]: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...
```

Note that the tapipy `t` object will store and pass your access token
for you, so you don\'t have to manually provide the token when using the
tapipy operations. You are now ready to check your access to the Tapis
APIs. It will expire though, after 4 hours, at which time you will need
to generate a new token. If you are interested, you can create an OAuth
client (a one-time setup step, like creating a TACC account) that can be
used to generate access and refresh tokens. For simplicity, we are
skipping that but if you are interested, check out the Tenancy and
Authentication section.

### Check Access to the Tapis APIs

The tapipy `t` object should now be configured to talk to all Tapis APIs
on your behalf. We can check that the client is configured properly by
making any API call. For example, we can use the authenticator service
to retrieve the full TACC profile of our user. To do so, use the
`get_profile()` function associated with the `authenticator` object on
the `t` object, passing the username of the profile to retrieve, as
follows.

``` python
t.authenticator.get_profile(username='apitest')

Out[1]:
create_time: None
dn: cn=apitest,ou=People,dc=tacc,dc=utexas,dc=edu
email: aci-cic@tacc.utexas.edu
username: apitest
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pods Quickstart

In this Quickstart, we will create an Pods service pod from a basic
Python function. Then we will get pod credentials and logs.

## Registering a templated Pod

To get started we\'re going to create a templated Pod. To do this, we
will use the `Tapis` client object we created above (see [Working with
TACC OAuth](#working-with-tacc-oauth)).

To register an pod using the tapipy library, we use the
`pods.create_pod()` method and pass the arguments describing the pod we
want to register through the function parameters. For example:

``` python
t.pods.create_pod(pod_id='docpod', pod_template='template/neo4j', description='My example pod!')
```

As you can see, we\'re using pod_template equal to
[template/neo4j]{.title-ref}, that is one of our templated pods. You
should see a response like this:

``` bash
creation_ts: None
data_attached: []
data_requests: []
description: My example pod!
environment_variables: 

pod_id: test
pod_template: template/neo4j
roles_inherited: []
roles_required: []
status: REQUESTED
status_container: 

status_requested: ON
update_ts: None
url: docpod.pods.tacc.develop.tapis.io
```

Notes:

-   The [pod_id]{.title-ref} given will be the id used by you to access
    the pod at all times. It must be lowercase and alphanumeric. It also
    must be unique within the tenant.
-   Pods returned a status of `REQUESTED` for the pod; behind the
    scenes, the Pods service has sent a message requesting the pod
    described to our backend [spawner]{.title-ref} infrastructure. The
    pod\'s image must be pulled, a pod service must be created (for
    networking), and the networking changes must propagate to the Pod\'s
    proxy before the Pod is ready for use.
-   When the pod itself has began running, the status will change to
    `RUNNING`. Networking must change before use though (1-2 minutes).
    Additionally, a `RUNNING` pod only means the pod itself has started,
    check pod logs to see what your container is actually doing (if it
    writes to stdout, else wait).

At any point we can check the details of our pods, including its status,
with the following:

``` python
t.pods.get_pod(pod_id='docpod')
```

The response format is identical to that returned from the
`t.pods.create_pod()` method.

## Accessing a Pod

Once your pod is in the `RUNNING` state, and after the networking
changes proliferate, you should have access to your pod via the
internet. In the case of templated pods, networking might be through a
TCP or HTTP connection. In the case of custom docker image pods,
networking always works by exposing port 5000 through HTTP.

To access your pod through the network though we can use the url
provided in the pod\'s description when creating the pod or when getting
the pod description as we did above. In the pod response object, the
`url` attribute gives you the url your service is being hosted on.

**Place cool example here of something we can call**

## Retrieving the Logs

The Pods service collects the latest 10 MB of logs (subject to change)
from the pod when running and makes them available via the `logs`
endpoint. Let\'s retrieve the logs from the pod we just made. We use the
`get_pod_logs()` method, passing in `pod_id`:

``` python
t.pods.get_pod_logs(pod_id='docpod')
```

The response should be similar to the following:

``` python

```

As you can see, because this is a Neo4J database template, we have the
logs from the Neo4J database initializes and getting to it\'s `Started`
state.
